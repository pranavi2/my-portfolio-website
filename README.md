Custom Google Fonts: Automatically optimized and loaded for the best performance.
Vercel Deployment: Continuously deployed via Vercel for hassle-free updates.
Interactive UI: Smooth navigation and a dynamic user experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
